        <p><b>IMPORTANCE OF NATURE...!<br></b></p>
        <p>If not for nature then we wouldnâ€™t be alive. The health benefits of nature for humans are incredible. The most important thing for survival given by nature is oxygen. <br>
        The entire cycle of respiration is regulated by nature. The oxygen that we inhale is given by trees and the carbon dioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees. <br>
        
        The ecosystem of nature is a community in which producers (plants), consumers, and decomposers work together in their environment for survival. <br>The natural fundamental processes like soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and water cycling, allows Earth to sustain life. We are dependent on these ecosystem services daily whether or not we are aware.
        
        Nature provides us services round the clock: provisional services, regulating services, and non-material services. <br>Provisional services include benefits extracted from nature such as food, water, natural fuels and fibers, and medicinal plants. Regulating services include regulation of natural processes that include decomposition, water purification, pollution, erosion and flood control, and also, climate regulation.
        
        Non-material services are the non-material benefits that improve the cultural development of humans such as recreation, creative inspiration from interaction with nature like art, music, architecture, and the influence of ecosystems on local and global cultures. 
        
        The interaction between humans and animals, which are a part of nature alleviates stress, lessens pain and worries. Nature provides company and gives people a sense of purpose. 
        
        Studies and researches have shown that children especially have a natural affinity with nature. The regular interaction with nature has boosted health development in children. Nature supports their physical and mental health and instills abilities to access risks as they grow.

            <p><b>What is nature short note?<br></b>
        The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature. ... <br>Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources. People cut down trees, mine ores, and grow crops.

        <p><em><b>What nature means to you?</b></em><br>
        When I step out of the everyday world I find a fulfillment within myself. Going into nature and being surrounded by the wisdom of the trees, the beauty of the grasses, <br>the inspiration of the mountains, and the warmth of the sun I can feel the subtle peace enter my body, mind, and spirit. I am now home once again.
